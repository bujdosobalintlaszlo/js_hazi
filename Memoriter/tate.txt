Every time I leave there’s tears in her eyes
She knows how I’m earning and wants me alive
The struggle is finished but I still only strive
Understand it’s how life taught me to survive

Every time Im moving there’s a strap no doubt
I don’t respect the law so why travel without
It’s rained and it’s poured I even built up a spout
The withouts want my buckets when living in drought

Every time we fuck I crush my soul into yours
We mix pain and insane with Eiffel Tower tours
I collect cash quiet behind double locked doors
Without profit to make there wouldn’t be wars

Money has no value so I give time with the don
You’re in love with my brains obsessed with my brawn
Enemies won’t stop now the guns have been drawn
I just hope you still love me after I’m gone
